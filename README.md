[//]: # (HOW TO PLAY)

[//]: # (Use arrow keys to move up, down, left and right)
[//]: # (Press Z to shoot) 

[//]: # (WHAT TO DO)

[//]: # (You have a set amount of lives (You start off with 3))
[//]: # (Get hit and you'll lose a life) 
[//]: # (Lose all of them and it's game over!)
[//]: # (So dodge and hold on as long as you can!)

[//]: # (BUT HOW DO I GET MORE LIVES?)
[//]: # (To avoid getting hit, remember that the enemies) 
[//]: # (moving up are faster than the enemies moving down)

[//]: # (But! You can get more lives by shooting down enemies) 
[//]: # (moving up and score points)
[//]: # (Every 50 points you gain a new life, so keep shooting!)
