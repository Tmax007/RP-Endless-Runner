HOW TO PLAY
-----------

1) Use arrow keys to move up, down, left and right
2) Press Z to shoot 


WHAT TO DO
----------

1) You have a set amount of lives (You start off with 3)
2) Get hit and you'll lose a life 
3) Lose all of them and it's game over!
4) So dodge and hold on as long as you can!


BUT HOW DO I GET MORE LIVES?
----------------------------

To avoid getting hit, remember that the enemies 
moving up are faster than the enemies moving down

But you can get more lives by shooting down enemies 
moving up and score points
Every 50 points you gain a new life, so keep shooting!
